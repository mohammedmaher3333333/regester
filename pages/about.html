	<h1>Delta Technology University</h1>
	<p class="dtu">Delta Technology University in Quesna, but it is unique in its chosen 
		location so that it is in the heart of the industrial zone in Quesna. That is, 
		you are located in the heart of the event. You learn inside the university. 
		First we have to understand what technological universities mean, their importance to us, why we 
		need them, and why they will be the beginning of changing the education system in Egypt?First of all, 
		technological universities are an educational system that combines practical reality, practice, and theoretical materials,
		 and its importance is that Egypt currently needs skilled technicians who combine “workmanship” 
		and science, working with their own hands in giant projects undertaken by the state, and it does not need to graduate 
   		<br><br> 
		thousands of engineers who are already present to design these Projects, designs exist and need to be implemented This 
		university will achieve the difficult equation that you will produce for us, as we mentioned, skilled technologists. 
		Keep them in these factories with rewarding salaries, and with all these factors, you will find that the demand for such sciences is great, 
		meaning that you will change the educational map in Egypt, not only this, but you will restore technical education to its throne.
